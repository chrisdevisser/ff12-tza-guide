# Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age - Perfect Game Guide

## Where to get it

Have a look at the [Releases page](https://github.com/chrisdevisser/ff12-tza-guide/releases), which contains HTML builds. Simply open the HTML file in a web browser.

If you don't mind viewing through GitHub, you can [view the Markdown file directly](https://github.com/chrisdevisser/ff12-tza-guide/blob/master/ff12-tza-perfect-game.md).

## Intro

This guide covers everything needed for a perfect game. This guide's definition is:

- Each bazaar item unlocked at least once
- All non-repeatable treasure obtained
- Order of Ambrosia
- At least one of every equipment obtained without buying it (when possible; bazaar is okay and buying extras is okay)
- Bestiary second pages complete
- Not necessarily the earliest opportunities
    - My first recommendation for this would be [xAshe10x's video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQMTNO6Wnog)

If this is your first time playing, then the guide will be hard to follow. This is meant for someone who's relatively familiar with the game.

For the bazaar in particular, deviating from the guide can easily result in losing track of things. It is expected that the guide is followed wholly.

## Motivation

There are many references out there, including the wiki and individual references for treasures, the bazaar, equipment, rare game, and more. However, there's nothing that combines these into a single chronological format. Perhaps video walkthroughs, but they're hard to follow along with at your own pace and to search, plus have a different definition of perfect game.

Rather than cross-referencing five different guides every time I get to the next area, I've done that work in advance. I started by listing story, sidequest, hunt, and treasure information, which is basically a regular walkthrough plus noting all of the noteworthy treasures along the way. Then I went through the rare game, loot, bazaar, and equipment, sprinkling in each one where it belonged. The result is something that can be read without needing to go look up things along the way.

Finally, making my own guide allows me to include personal preferences (e.g., jobs) so that I don't have to research or look them up as I play through.

## Format

The information is presented minimally. Look elsewhere for explanations. The goal is to present the necessary information that isn't as easy to remember, and for it to be easy to follow.

## Jobs and Espers

The guide contains specific job and esper assignments. Feel free to use your own, or use these if you don't like picking for yourself. You'll notice that these aren't even my choices, they're xAshe10x's.

## Contributing

Remember that this guide reflects a lot of personal preferences. Not everything listed will be for everyone. Improvements to the guide should be objective (e.g., typo corrections or fixing incorrect information). 

If you want to submit a correction, it's best to create a pull request with the changes. Alternatively, start an issue and I can make the actual change myself.
